						<p>I am both a debater and a programmer. I am passionate about combining those two things. I have worked on programs that help intigrate refugees sustainible and hope to continue in that line of work. Algorthims can be used in every day life they aren't just for high lelvel tech and video games. IF we apply tech in places we don't normally we can radicalize the effficenty of many systems: hospitals, immugration and EMT services just to name a few. My passion is trying to make those connections in order to make that happen. </p>

There are very few women comparedto the the number of men who chose to ccode as a disipline, I want to show that that doesn't have to be the case.</p>
